When adding examples to the repository, please place your examples within their own directory containing a text file with the svn version number (ie version of the framework) which the buttons were created with.

So, 

Examples/myFunExamples/

Would contain your xibs which contain the examples, and a text file with something like 

Works with versions between 36 - 78.

Or something like that.

This way if the button structure ever changes and is incompatible, people can still check out the previous version and look at your designs.
