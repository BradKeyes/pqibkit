The aim of this kit is to make it easy to design beautiful animated views and controls without writing any code.

You configure your objects within interface builder, by loading the palette. Then you can use the objects you design within your own application nibs or xibs by just copy and pasting them there, and including the framework in your xcode project.

The kit isn't finished, and there are still a number of limitations. I'm looking for help to shape and clean it up, so we can all make use of this tool in our application interfaces.

I haven't officially announced the location of this yet, so if you've stumbled upon this, well done!
